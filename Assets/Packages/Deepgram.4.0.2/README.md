# Documentation

Complete documentation of the .NET SDK can be found on the
[Deepgram Docs](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/dotnet-sdk).

You can learn more about the full Deepgram API at [https://developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com).

# Getting an API Key

🔑 To access the Deepgram API, you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

# Requirements

This SDK supports the following versions:

- .NET 8.0
- .NET 7.0
- .NET 6.0

# Installation

To install the latest version of the C# SDK using NuGet (latest means this version will guarantee change over time), run the following command from your terminal in your project's directory:

```bash
dotnet add package Deepgram
```

Or use the NuGet package Manager. Right click on project and select manage NuGet packages.

### Installing the Previous Version

We guarantee that major interfaces will not break in a given major semver (ie, `4.*` release). However, all bets are off moving from a `3.*` to `4.*` major release. This follows standard semver best-practices.

To install the previous major version of the .NET SDK, run the following command from your terminal in your project's directory:

```bash
dotnet add package Deepgram --version 3.4.2
```

# Quickstarts

This SDK aims to reduce complexity and abstract/hide some internal Deepgram details that clients shouldn't need to know about.  However, you can still tweak options and settings if you need.

## PreRecorded Audio Transcription Quickstart

You can find a [walkthrough](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/pre-recorded-audio-transcription) on our documentation site. Transcribing Pre-Recorded Audio can be done using the following sample code:

```csharp
// JSON options
JsonSerializerOptions options = new(JsonSerializerDefaults.Web)
{
  WriteIndented = true
};

// Set "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" environment variable to your Deepgram API Key
var deepgramClient = new PreRecordedClient();

var response = await deepgramClient.TranscribeUrl(
  new UrlSource("https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"),
  new PreRecordedSchema()
  {
    Model = "nova-2",
  });

Console.WriteLine(response);
```

## Live Audio Transcription Quickstart

You can find a [walkthrough](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/live-streaming-audio-transcription) on our documentation site. Transcribing Live Audio can be done using the following sample code:

```csharp
// Set "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" environment variable to your Deepgram API Key
var liveClient = new LiveClient();

// Subscribe to the EventResponseReceived event
liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<OpenResponse>((sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"\n\n----> {e.Type} received");
}));
liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<MetadataResponse>((sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"----> {e.Type} received");
}));
liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<ResultResponse>((sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"----> Speaker: {e.Channel.Alternatives[0].Transcript}");
}));
liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<SpeechStartedResponse>((sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"----> {e.Type} received");
}));
liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<UtteranceEndResponse>((sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"----> {e.Type} received");
}));
liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<CloseResponse>((sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"----> {e.Type} received");
}));
liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<UnhandledResponse>((sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"----> {e.Type} received");
}));
liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<ErrorResponse>((sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"----> { e.Type} received. Error: {e.Message}");
}));

// Start the connection
var liveSchema = new LiveSchema()
{
    Model = "nova-2",
    Encoding = "linear16",
    SampleRate = 16000,
    Punctuate = true,
    SmartFormat = true,
    InterimResults = true,
    UtteranceEnd = "1000",
    VadEvents = true,
};
await liveClient.Connect(liveSchema);

// Microphone streaming
var microphone = new Microphone(liveClient.Send);
microphone.Start();

// Wait for the user to press a key
Console.ReadKey();

// Stop the microphone
microphone.Stop();

// Stop the connection
await liveClient.Stop();
```

# Logging

This SDK uses [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog) to perform all of its logging tasks. By default, this SDK will enable `Information` level messages and higher (ie `Warning`, `Error`, etc.) when you initialize the library as follows:

```csharp
// Default logging level is "Information"
Library.Initialize();
```

To increase the logging output/verbosity for debug or troubleshooting purposes, you can set the `Debug` level but using this code:

```csharp
Library.Initialize(LogLevel.Debug);
```

# Backwards Compatibility

Older SDK versions will receive Priority 1 (P1) bug support only. Security issues, both in our code and dependencies, are promptly addressed. Significant bugs without clear workarounds are also given priority attention.
